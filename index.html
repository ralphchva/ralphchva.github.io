        <h2> Stay </h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            I know we had our ups and downs, good times and bad times, and all I want to say is thank you. Thank you for putting up with me. I know I'm not be the best person to be around with. I can be annoying sometimes, overly jealous, and I tend to be late on some of our dates, but I want you to know that I'm trying. I want to be a better person for you. I know you will say that I don't have to change for you, but I want to. I want to make this the best relationship you have been in. I also want to take initiative one day. I don't want you to be the only one planning where we go to. I want to be able to surprise you, to make you feel special. Until then, know that I'm getting there. I will get there someday. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            You have no idea how much you have changed my life for the better. Your hugs and kisses always make me feel like I'm the luckiest man alive. I'm never sad when you are around. It's like all my problems and doubts go away, and if they don't, you help me overcome them. I don't know if I have been a good boyfriend to you, but hey, you're still here, so I must be doing something right, right? I do hope so. I also want you to know that if you want me to, I will be here to stay. I will be by your side through thick and thin, and through all the memories we will experience, together. </p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            To my present, I hope I can be your future as well, because I want you to be mine. </p>

        <h2> Someday Soon </h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            To the ones who did not give up on me, thank you. When I am having a bad day, no matter how tired you are, you still make sure I am feeling better at the end of the day. When I need help on something, you don't hesitate to stop what you are doing, and guide me through it. You give me the best care that you can, even though sometimes I fail to do the same. The list goes on, and I wouldn't finish them if I listed them all here, but that doesn't mean I appreciate those any less. I will be forever grateful for all the things you have done for me. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            I may be older now, and we tend to disagree more nowadays, but it doesn't mean that I love you any less. I still take everything you say to heart, but there are times where I have to make my own decisions, so that in the future, I will take care of you the best I could, the same way you are doing now. In order for me to do that I need to be independent, to rely on my own decisions more, to learn from them. But until then, I will try to listen more to you, because I know you can guide me through until it's my time to guide others. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Words can't say how much you mean to me, so in a few years, let me show it to you. </p>

        <h2> No Need to Rush </h2>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            It's been a couple of rough days right? Quizzes, long tests, projects, top that with extra curriculars and you've got yourself one heck of a week. I know it's hard, and I know it can be a bit challenging to work, to study, even to wake up every morning. You don't feel satisfaction with your work anymore, and you feel like you don't have motivation for anything anymore. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            What I want you to do is breathe, take it easy, even take a step back if you have to. I know you have work to do, and you have a lot of things on your plate, but let me tell you this; you are more important. Everyone deserves rest, even you. No, especially you. Take a walk, watch your favorite show, read a book, play a game, do anything that makes you feel nice, anything that makes you feel like yourself. Find yourself again. You need motivation? Find one. It can be anything; small things such as a gathering at the end of the week, seeing your friends, even getting that sleep you deserve so much after a long day, anything really, just so long as it gets you to get up in the morning, it's enough. Know your friends will be there for you, and that you will be there for them as well. Know that whatever you are going through, you are going to make it. You are going to live a beautiful life, full of the people around you, and full of the things you want. I know you have to work to get there, but sometimes taking a step back to breathe is needed more. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            So breathe. Live life not like a race, but like a leisurely stroll. Enjoy the view, see the sights, make connections along the way. Go on, you have plenty of time. </p>

        <h2> To One That Life Forbid </h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            I haven't known her for long, yet whenever I see her she manages to brighten up my day. Whether it's her smile, a simple wave, or a short conversation while going in the same direction, it brings me life, a kind of sweet, giddy feeling inside that I can't quite explain. Maybe it's because I've put off finding someone for so long I'd forgotten what it felt like, or maybe it's something else. The world is mysterious like that. The way she smiles at me is like any other smile, but somehow I deem it different, like this smile that gives me warmth, comfort, and it never fails to cheer me up after a terrible day. I can't help but notice her facial expressions whenever we talk; it's so full of life, even if she just had an all nighter and is seemingly dying because of her thesis. Maybe it's just me, but I guess it's what happens. You see that person as someone you want to be a part of your life, a constant, or maybe something even more. I can't grasp my feelings right now, but theres a side of me that says that I'm lying; I've fallen for her, and theres nothing I can do about it. But I can't act on my feelings. Life just doesn't allow it. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            I find people that I want to be with for the rest of my life, but theres always something. I thought I'd learned my lesson from the last time, but I guess I was just resting. Taking a break from letting my heart pour out into someone, only for one factor to break it all apart, leaving me in a big, hurting, pile of sadness. This time, there is even tears. Tears of hopelessness, of feeling that there is nothing I can do about it. I could try to do something about it, but I know it's not a sure thing. If it works, It's going to make me happy for the rest of my life. The drawback? If it doesn't work, she'll be out of my life forever, and I don't think I can live with that. Here I am again, stuck in my vicious cycle of hurt, not knowing what to do, and feeling lost to the point that I don't even know if I can go back. </p>
